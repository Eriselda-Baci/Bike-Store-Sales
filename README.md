# Bike Store Sales
### Linear Regression and Clustering

## Summary
##### Bike Store is a company that sales bikes and accessories across world. By analyzing this data, the company can optimize their pricing and inventory strategies, and even tailor their marketing approach to different customer groups.

## Objectives
##### The objective of this project is to analyze the sales and profitability of Bike Store, a company that sells bikes and accessories worldwide, and provide insights that can help the company optimize their pricing and inventory strategies. This will be achieved through the use of linear regression, clustering, and forecasting techniques to answer key business questions such as identifying the best and worst performing markets in terms of sales and profitability, understanding the relationship between unit cost and profit, and determining the most profitable product categories and sub-categories. The results will be presented in Tableau dashboards and a final presentation for management.

## Key Questions 
##### • Which states and countries are our best and worst performing markets in terms of sales and profitability?
##### •	Is there a relationship between Unit Cost and Profit for our products?
##### •	How correlate variables with each other, Unit Cost, Profit, Prices, Unit Price and Revenue?
##### •	Which product categories and sub-categories are the most profitable for us?

## Context

##### Using Linear Regression, Cluster and Forecaste to answer business questions and to meet the objective of this dataset is to leverage the power of data analytics to drive business growth and profitability by making informed decisions based on the relationship between Unit Cost and Profit. Then translate these answers into Tableau to create visuals and Dashboards. Finally create final presentation for management to view.

## Find results and recommendations
#### The Bike Store Sale should be considered how it can adjust the company's strategies in response to changing market conditions and new information to ensure continued growth and profitability:


####- The regression equation can be used to predict the expected profit for a given unit cost. This information can be used to inform pricing strategies and product development decisions.


####- Cluster analysis can optimize product pricing strategy by segmenting products into groups based on unit cost and profit.


####-Inventory management can be improved by focusing on high-profit margin products and adjusting inventory levels accordingly.


####-Marketing strategy can be tailored to different customer groups based on buying behavior and preferences identified through clustering analysis, leading to increased profits over time.


####-The forecast suggests that the company may need to adjust its pricing strategy and/or cost structure to maintain profitability in the face of decreasing Unit Costs. 


####- Alternatively, the company may need to explore opportunities to increase sales volume to offset the decrease in Profit.




## Limitations of the case study:


####- There weren't enough data points to yield a highly significant result. 
####- The data contained a limited number of variables upon which to conduct the analysis. 
####-A dataset up to date will be more accurately for forecasting and analysis itself.


## Next steps: 


####- Gather more data points for these variables.
####- Run a classification algorithm to see whether we can predict Profit based on the labels we created.
####- Analyze the impact of additional variables on the Unit Cost of products.

## Data Set
